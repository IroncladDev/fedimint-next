# Multimint

An example of using the [Fedimint Clientd](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint-clientd) to interact with multiple fedimints simultaneously.

Calls to the fedimint client daemon are made on the server-side through [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components). and [React Server Actions](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-actions).

## Features

- Join multiple fedimints
- Redeem ecash notes for individual fedimints, demonstrating how each fedimint has its own state
